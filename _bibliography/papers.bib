abstract = {So far, most of those vaccinated have developed resistance to the novel coronavirus, one step closer to achieving immunity step. In this paper, factors of vaccine and virus variation were newly considered in the original SIR Model, and a SIRU primary model was established to illustrate the influence of the control of vaccine coverage rate on the establishment of immune barrier. Combined with the vaccine efficiency and virus mutation rate, the primary model was improved to obtain a SIRU higher-order model. Finally, the relevant data were used for processing and analysis, and it was concluded that the higher the vaccination rate, the higher the vaccine effectiveness, the lower the virus mutation rate and the stronger the immune barrier effect. Finally, by introducing the determination of epidemic-economy correlation coefficient and information entropy method to determine the weight and rank of each economic index, the weighted rank sum ratio was calculated to quantitatively analyze and compare the economic level of the implementation of physical isolation and the establishment of immune barrier, and corresponding conclusions were drawn.},
