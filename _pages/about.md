I am a senior undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Beijing Institute of Technology(BIT), China.

I am currently engaged in research that revolves around the field of 3D computer vision. I feel fortunate to be working under the supervision of Professor ZHAO Hao at the DISCOVER Lab, Institute for AI Industry Research, Tsinghua University.
